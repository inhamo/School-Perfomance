# School Performance Analysis

Welcome to the School Performance Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance data, aiming to uncover insights and patterns that can inform educational strategies and interventions.

## Overview

The project focuses on analyzing various factors that influence student performance, including study habits, extracurricular activities, parental support, and more. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights to improve student outcomes.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/school-performance-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd school-performance-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis includes various attributes related to students, such as:

- **StudentID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **Age**: Age of the student
- **Gender**: Gender of the student
- **Ethnicity**: Ethnic background of the student
- **ParentalEducation**: Education level of the student's parents
- **StudyTimeWeekly**: Hours spent studying per week
- **Absences**: Number of school absences
- **Tutoring**: Whether the student receives tutoring
- **ParentalSupport**: Level of parental support
- **Extracurricular**: Participation in extracurricular activities
- **Sports**: Involvement in sports
- **Music**: Participation in music activities
- **Volunteering**: Involvement in volunteering activities
- **GPA**: Grade Point Average
- **GradeClass**: Class grade

## Analysis

The analysis used Python, with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The following steps were performed:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured data consistency.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized the data to understand various attributes' distribution and central tendencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential outliers.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Tested hypotheses to determine the significance of various factors on student performance.
5. **Regression Analysis**: Built regression models to predict GPA based on various factors.

## Key Findings

- **Study Time**: A positive correlation between study time and GPA indicates that more study hours generally lead to better performance.
- **Parental Support**: Higher levels of parental support are associated with better student performance.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in extracurricular activities, especially sports and music, positively impacts student GPA.
- **Absences**: Increased school absences negatively affect student performance.
